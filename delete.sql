-- Always do a select before a delete to make sure you get back exactly what you want and only what you want to delete!
-- Since we cannot delete anything from the pre-defined tables (foreign key restraints), let’s go make our own tables in SQL Tabs! (Technically, you can create tables in the Postgres Sandbox too, but let’s practice with SQL Tabs.)


-- # Open up SQL Tabs and connect to the Heroku DB you set up during the demo.

-- Create a table called animals that has 4 columns: id - serialized integer that’s the primary key, name - can be any data type that holds strings, type - also for strings, and age which will be a whole number.
CREATE TABLE animals ( 
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
    name VARCHAR(50), 
    type TEXT, 
    age INTEGER 
);
-- Next, run the commented code provided in delete.sql to insert some data into your table.

-- Try selecting from animals to confirm that everything worked.

SELECT * FROM animals;



-- Delete all ‘lion’ entries from the table.
DELETE 
FROM animals
WHERE type = 'lion';
-- Delete all animals whose names start with “M”.
DELETE 
FROM animals
WHERE name LIKE 'M%';
-- Delete all entries whose age is less than 9.
DELETE 
FROM animals
WHERE age < 9;
